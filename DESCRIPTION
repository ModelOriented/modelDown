Description: `modelDown` generates a website with HTML summaries for predictive models.
    This package uses DALEX explainers to describe local and global model behavior. 
    We can see how exactly scores for predictions were calculated (Prediction BreakDown), 
    how much each variable contributes to predictions (Variable Response), 
    which variables are the most important for a given model (Variable Importance) 
    and how well out models behave (Model Performance).
