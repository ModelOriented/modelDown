Description: Website generator with HTML summaries for predictive models.
    This package uses 'DALEX' explainers to describe global model behavior. 
    We can see how well models behave (tabs: Model Performance, Auditor),
    how much each variable contributes to predictions (tabs: Variable Response) 
    and which variables are the most important for a given model (tabs: Variable Importance).
    We can also compare Concept Drift for pairs of models (tabs: Drifter).
    Additionally, data available on the website can be easily recreated in current R session.
    Work on this package was financially supported by the NCN Opus grant 2017/27/B/ST6/01307 
    at Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science.
